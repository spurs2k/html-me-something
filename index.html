                        While in the lobby of the FedEx Forum in Memphis, on the Concrete and Gold Tour, my buddy Jerry couldn't believe his eyes when he thought he saw Dave Grohl. 
                        Turns out it was just some long haired guy trying to sell extra tickets. What would Dave have been doing in the lobby this close to show time anyway?
                        Perhaps there was alcohol to blame for the confusion. That's rock and roll!!!</p>

                            I helped build the stage for a concert in Little Rock! It was organized chaos. Completely bananas!!! Unfortunately I did not get a photo, but it looked like this!!! 
                            The monitors were a triangle with two concave screens and one convex screen. During the concert, they would spin around and tilt while displaying images and video. 
                            The effect was really cool to see in action!!!</p>

                                Back before he formed the Foo Fighters, Dave Grohl was in a little band called Nirvana. You might have heard of them. While with Nirvana, Grohl came
                                across a beautiful 1967 Trini Lopez Signature guitar in a Bethesda, Maryland guitar shop. Dave is on record as saying, 
                                "This guitar, I've made every single Foo Fighters record with it. On every record I might use other guitars every now and then, but for the most part 
                                it's just this." While the original guitar was a deep red color, in 2007 Gibson released a Grohl signature model in Pelham Blue which became his favorite 
                                guitar!</p>

                                <p class="captions"><span style="font-size: 35px" style="font-weight: bold;">This horrible band name....</span>
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    It is widely known that Dave got the name for his new band from Allied World War II pilots. The term "foo fighter" was used to describe various UFOs or 
                                    mysterious aerial phenomena seen in the skies over both the European and Pacific theaters of operations. It is suspected that the pilots were overworked, 
                                    exhausted, and hallucinating. Given the circumstances, that seems reasonable. Nevertheless, we have this incredible band name! Or do we??? In an interview 
                                    with Anderson Cooper, behind the scenes of the <em>Sonic Highways</em> documentary, Grohl revealed, "Had I imagined that it would last more than a 
                                    month-and-a-half, I might have named it something else. It’s the dumbest band name ever." Agree to disagree Mr Grohl!!!</p>

                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Did you know that Dave recorded nearly all the instruments by himself on the Foo Fighters debut album? When it was time to go on tour, 
                                        Dave was going to need some help! Enter former Sunny Day Real Estate drummer William Goldsmith. According to Grohl, Goldsmith's drumming had good moments, 
                                        but for the most part his performances were not to Grohl’s standards, so Dave ended up re-recording all the drum parts himself for the Foo's second studio album. 
                                        Grohl asked Goldsmith to remain as the band's tour drummer but the damage was done. Goldsmith's replacement came from a very unlikely source. Taylor Hawkins
                                        was the drummer for Alanis Morissette when he left for the Foo Fighters. Hawkins remains the Foo's drummer to this day! </p>
