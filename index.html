                <h3>This one time, at a Foo Fighters show....</h3>
                <p>While in the lobby of the FedEx Forum in Memphis, on the Concrete and Gold Tour, my buddy Jerry couldn't believe his eyes when he thought he saw Dave Grohl. 
                Turns out it was just some long haired guy trying to sell extra tickets. What would Dave have been doing in the lobby this close to show time anyway?
                Perhaps there was alcohol to blame for the confusion. That's rock and roll!!!</p>
